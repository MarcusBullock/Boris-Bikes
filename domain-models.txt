OBJECTS                      MESSAGES
                    
person                       check_bike_is_working
bike                         release_the_bike
docking station              



DIAGRAM:

The object is bike, and we want the object to be given the message by the docking station - “RELEASE”.

In the next user story, the bike is again the object, which is given the message, “IS THIS BIKE WORKING?”. -> TRUE / FALSE
